		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks for initializing the repository, configuring the folder structure, installing each dependency, setting up ESLint and Prettier, creating the GitHub Actions workflow, and verifying the setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but relatively straightforward, involving standard setup steps and dependency installation. Each step is discrete and can be handled independently, but the number of tools and integrations justifies a moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing OAuth device flow, token encryption, token refresh/validation, CLI command, secure credential storage, error handling, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "OAuth flows, secure storage, and encryption add significant complexity, especially with error handling and CLI integration. Each aspect requires careful implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Data Ingest Module",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for API pagination, caching in SQLite, fetching genres, extended mode, progress bar, CLI command, batch requests, retry logic, and performance testing.",
			"reasoning": "Fetching, paginating, caching, and handling large datasets with error handling and performance constraints make this a complex, multi-faceted task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Label Discovery Algorithm",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for histogram generation, filter implementation, d3-array integration, config storage, CLI command, parallel processing, and memory optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Algorithm development, data analysis, parallelism, and memory optimization for large datasets contribute to high complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Playlist Generation Module",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for playlist key generation, name templating, collision handling, API integration, rate limiting, SQLite mapping, CLI command, and progress bar.",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful handling of API limits, deterministic mapping, batch operations, and user feedback, all of which increase complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Preview and Confirmation System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for table display, CLI command, preview formatting, interactive confirmation, flag handling, dry-run mode, and lockfile mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "Involves CLI UI, user interaction, and concurrency control, but each component is well-defined and can be modularized."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Rollback Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for rollback data storage, CLI command, playlist deletion, partial failure handling, data expiration, and scheduling.",
			"reasoning": "Requires reliable state management, error handling, and integration with scheduling, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI Status Command",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for CLI command, scan status retrieval, token validity check, last run info display, color-coding, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Primarily involves data retrieval and display logic, with some error handling and formatting, resulting in moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Implement Caching",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for metadata caching, batch requests, parallel processing, SQLite optimization, skip logic, streaming, and memory optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization and caching across multiple modules, with strict runtime and memory constraints, make this one of the most complex tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for custom error class, winston integration, log levels, log rotation, error reporting, detailed messages, and graceful degradation.",
			"reasoning": "Centralized error handling and robust logging require careful design and integration across the application, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for Jest setup, unit tests, integration tests, HTTP mocking, coverage reporting, CI integration, and snapshot testing.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving high coverage and robust integration testing across a complex CLI app is challenging and requires multiple coordinated efforts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare for Distribution and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for npm packaging, README, API docs, contributing guidelines, versioning, automated publishing, website setup, user guides, and help command.",
			"reasoning": "Preparing for distribution involves technical, documentation, and automation tasks, each with its own requirements and dependencies."
